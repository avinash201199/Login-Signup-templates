# How to Contribute

If you have a login or signup template you'd like to add, please follow these steps.

### ## Adding a New Template

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the main repository to your own GitHub account.

2.  **Create Your Folder:** Inside the main directory, create a new folder. Please give it a descriptive name (e.g., `Modern-Dark-Login`).

3.  **Add Your Code:** Place all of your template's files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, etc.) inside the folder you just created.

4.  **Add a Screenshot:**
    * Take a screenshot of your template in action.
    * Save it as a `.png` file.
    * The filename must **exactly match** your folder's name (e.g., if your folder is `Modern-Dark-Login`, your screenshot must be named `Modern-Dark-Login.png`).
    * Place your screenshot inside the main `screenshots` folder.

5.  **Update the Website:**
    * Open the main `script.js` file at the root of the project.
    * Find the `templateFolders` array at the top of the file.
    * Add the name of your new folder to this list. The list is alphabetical, so please place yours in the correct order.

6.  **Create a Pull Request:** Commit your changes and open a Pull Request to the main repository. We will review it as soon as possible!
