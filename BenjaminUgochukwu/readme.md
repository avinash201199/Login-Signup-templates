README — Modern Minimal Login
Overview

A single-file, production-ready login screen built with HTML + CSS + vanilla JS. It uses a minimal aesthetic with a soft glass card, animated gradient glow (respects prefers-reduced-motion), and accessible form controls.

Features

Responsive: Works beautifully from 320px to large desktops (max card width ~420px).

Accessible: Proper labels, focus styles, ARIA live regions for error text, keyboard-friendly controls.

Dark-mode aware: Uses prefers-color-scheme; colors adapt automatically.

Subtle motion: Ambient glow animation; reduced motion respected.

Client-side UX: Real-time validation, password show/hide toggle, disabled loading state on submit.

No dependencies: Pure CSS + JS; no external fonts or icons.

Easy theming: Centralized CSS variables for brand and surface colors.
